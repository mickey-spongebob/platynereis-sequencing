# Platynereis PACBIO sequencing

## Summary
High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from a  single _Platynereis dumerilii_ male from the EMBL-Heidelberg, 
GERMANY culture ('wild-type'). This included both sperm and somatic tissue DNA. The sample was then sent to the Whitney 
Laboratory for Marine Bioscience, Florida USA for PacBio long-read sequencing.
